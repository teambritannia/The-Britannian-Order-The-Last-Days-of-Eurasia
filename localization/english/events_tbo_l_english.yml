 britannian_prosperity.1.d: "Starting situation of Greater Britannia"
 britannian_prosperity.1.f: "Greater Britannia, in 1836, stands in a secure position. She owns Slavian Russ and Britannian Arabia as dominions, in addition to holding the Chinese Federation as a protectorate. Internally, the wealth of the country grows ever more quickly. \n\n However, the nation is nowhere near invincible. Independence movements and dissenters, while heavily suppressed, still manage to arise in the periphery of the Empire's stretches. Any further mismanagement could lead to disaster..."
 britannian_prosperity.1.a: "Hail Britannia!"
 
 je_britannian_prosperity_reason: "Greater Britannia, on the surface, seems to be in an eternal golden age. Yet upon closer inspection of the Empire Under the Sun reveals that its position is, in fact, quite precarious. As nationalist sentiments rise across its conquered territories, only time will tell whether the Britannian Empire will survive into the twentieth century in its full glory."
 je_britannia_collapse_tt: "Should various colonial wars overwhelm Britannia's might, the Empire will lose control over its expansive holdings, resigned to an uncertain fate for the remaining Home Islands..."

 britannian_prosperity.3.t: "The Mexican War"
 britannian_prosperity.3.d: "Mexico has declared war on Britannia-controlled North Mexico in a bid to reclaim its lost lands"
 britannian_prosperity.3.f: "The analyst stared at the report in his hand, unable to comprehend what he was seeing. His hand trembled; the paper fell to the ground amid hysterical screams from outside his window, as the terrified masses outside searched for some inch of sanity to clutch to. \n\n"They could not!" he yelled to himself, prancing about the disheveled room, tearing down haphzardly pinned charts from the walls, upending tables amid the protests of his secretary. Amid a flurry of papers he yelled and threw himself at the window, and within seconds had made his way through the shattered glass to join the hysteria on the streets below. \n\nWhat they had believed would be an eternal peace was only the beginning, heralded by a retaliation from a vengeful Mexico."
 britannian_prosperity.3.a: "This is a disaster!"
 britannian_prosperity.4.t: "The Britannian Opportunity"
 britannian_prosperity.4.d: "A war between Britannia and Mexico presents an opportunity for Dai Nam to place Britannian Indochina under its control"
 britannian_prosperity.4.f: "Many in Dai Nam have been advocating for an incursion into Britannian Indochina. The patchwork state has long been neglected by Britannian home authorities, and the focus on Mexico currently means that a sudden Vietnamese invasion will, provided sufficient speed, crush the Indochinese dominion before Britannia is even able to retaliate. The only question is, will the leaders of Dai Nam take on this reckless but potentially massively rewarding task?"
 britannian_prosperity.4.a: "Chance!"
 britannian_prosperity.4.b: "This plan is insane!"
 britannian_prosperity.5.t: "The Vietnam War"
 britannian_prosperity.5.d: "Capitalizing on the opportunity of Britannia's war against Mexico, Dai Nam has declared war to take control of Britannian Indochina."
 britannian_prosperity.5.f: "The Britannian embassy was woken in the morning by Vietnamese cannons blasting down its walls. The entire city had been overwhelmed quickly, the garrison slaughtered by the quick advance. They had not been expecting an attack, having the full backing of the Britannian Army \n\n Amid crumbling walls the Vietnamese troops advanced through crumbling and scorched walls, confident that they were to bring about a new future for their country."
 britannian_prosperity.5.a: "This is a disaster!"

 german_british_split.1.t: "Germany, forever"
 german_british_split.1.d: "Starting situation of Germany"
 german_british_split.1.f: "During the great Conquests Germany aided Britannia in her wars across the globe, and in return she was made whole again with the blessing of the world's most powerful empire. \n\nYet Britannian arrogance towards the newly reborn Germany has angered many. Now, German-Britannian relations seem to be headed towards an inevitable collapse. With only her subjects in Scandinavia, Africa, and Italy standing behind her, how will Germany fare when faced with the wrath of a domineering Britannia?"
 german_british_split.1.a: "May the world tremble before the might of Germany!"
 german_british_split.2.t: "Greater Britannia demands tribute"
 german_british_split.2.d: "Greater Britannia is demanding that the German State pay a tribute for five years"
 german_british_split.2.f: ""Damn Britannians, thinking they can shove us around like that," Hans muttered, ruffling his collar. It was hot inside the building, with the sun staring down the window and onto the scattered papers strewn about his desk. To pay, or not to pay?\n\nIt was a difficult question, one that plagued Hans as much as he knew it plagued the leaders of Germany, God save the Kaiser. They had had enough of such disgraces, fit for a backwards nation like the Chinese Federation or India. For a proud, modern state like Germany... this was disgraceful treatment!\n\nHans worked himself into a rage as he walked round and round the room, becoming more agitated with each step. British! Lounging on their islands and sucking the blood of Germans. Honest, hard-working Germans!\n\nBy this point, Hans had worked himself into a frothing rage, but forced himself to sit down. His decision of course would be by no means final, but what was it to be? Submit, or defy?"
 german_british_split.2.a: "Blast. We'll pay the tribute."
 german_british_split.2.b: "Bow to Britannia? Never!"
 german_british_split.3.t: "Army speaks out against Britannian domination"
 german_british_split.3.d: "Prominent figures in the Army of Germany have given speeches encouraging popular sentiments against Greater Britannia"
 german_british_split.3.f: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('galeader').GetFullName] has given a speech in Berlin speaking against the influence Greater Britannia holds over Germany. While the speech was scheduled for three in the afternoon, a significant crowd had already gathered by noon, and by the time [SCOPE.sCharacter('galeader').GetLastName] arrived the crowd had grown restless enough as to damage several Britannian assets near the plaza.\n\nMany have been alarmed by the inflammatory nature of [SCOPE.sCharacter('galeader').GetLastName]'s speech, and the Britannian embassy has already issued a strong objection, requesting that the German Army be purged of anti-Britannian elements. With pro-Britannian politicians dominating the intelligentsia in Germany, many have turned to the disgruntled army as a savior and a symbol of reclamation of German national pride."
 german_british_split.3.a: "Such is the spirit of a real German!"
 german_british_split.3.b: "These dangerous sentiments must be contained!"
 german_british_split.3.c: "This is unacceptable. Imprison [SCOPE.sCharacter('galeader').GetLastName]!"

 rebel_victoria.1.t: "The Rebel Victoria"
 rebel_victoria.1.d: "Situation of the traitor Alexandrina Victoria and her treacherous anti-Britannian organization"
 rebel_victoria.1.f: "Even as the mighty Greater Britannian Empire struggles to hold on to its vast colonial holdings, the empire's home isles, its most precocious core, are not safe, either. Had the Cromwells not taken over Britain then Alexandrina Victoria might've had a chance at the throne, however far-fetched a hope.\n\n Yet now she leads, or at least is suspected to lead, a loose coalition termed by the press as the 'black hand'. Having already carried out several high-profile assassinations on important public officials, they are a dangerous force to the stability of Greater Britannia."
 rebel_victoria.1.a: "We will keep a close eye on this situation"
 rebel_victoria.2.t: "Black Hand shoots [SCOPE.sCharacter('deadguy_scope').GetFullName]"
 rebel_victoria.2.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('deadguy_scope').GetFullName] has been shot by Victoria's rebels in London"
 rebel_victoria.2.f: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('deadguy_scope').GetFirstName] looked at his watch and frowned. The train was running late; it was already a minute or so past the time it was supposed to have arrived. For a public figure as important as himself this was an utter disgrace to his dignity; it was already outrageous that it had not arrived early for him.\n\n Bored, he surveyed the crowd and took in the other passengers, many of whom seemed strangely unbothered by this irritating disruption that would throw his delicately packed schedule completely out of balance. The filthy masses crowded left and right, with worn caps peeking over the sea of heads. One carried a large package that required his full strength to lift. Another carefully held an ornate wooden box that looked to be some kind of heirloom. They did not concern [SCOPE.sCharacter('deadguy_scope').GetLastName]; he was above the rabble. He was a servant of Greater Britannia, of the greatest empire of the world.\n\n He did not think that anyone would dare to shoot him, not in a public place like this where a peeler would be around the corner, yet the man with the box fired anyway. He drew a small pistol; it was big enough to drive a bullet through [SCOPE.sCharacter('deadguy_scope').GetLastName]'s chest. Blood erupted from the ruined vest and he fell to the ground screaming to help, before the air escaped from his punctured lungs. He would bleed out soon. The sky above him mixed with terrified faces and the looming London skyline, the station's awning, into a warm mixture of fading color..."
 rebel_victoria.2.a: "How could we have let this happen?"
 rebel_victoria.2.b: "Deny the Black Hand's involvement!"
 rebel_victoria.3.t: "Black Hand bombs upper class salon"
 rebel_victoria.3.d: "The Refined Gentleman, an upper class political salon, was recently bombed by Victoria's rebel organization."
 rebel_victoria.3.f: ""Would you get me some tea, Alastair?" Barnaby Fetherstonehaugh asked his companion, as he set a spent cigar into a fine porcelain ashtray which itself was perched on a handcrafted rosewood cabinet imported directly from the Chinese Federation. Alastair nodded and walked across the lavish rug laid out across the floor of the Refined Gentleman's saloon, through a thin haze of pleasant incense, then poured a miniscule amount of tea into a small glass cup.\n\n "Your tea, sir", Alastair said to Barnaby, as the latter reclined on his armchair and sipped his tea. Adjusting his monocle, he then proceeded to glance outside, where there was some kind of commotion. A gang of boys was running past the grimy street as two patrolmen yelled for them to stop.\n\n "My, the children these days certainly are----Alastair?" Barnaby squealed as the terrified butler dove behind the armchair, followed moments later by a heavy bomb smashing through the salon's window, with refractive shards scattering across the ruined rug as several visiting gentlemen screamed in horror. The fuse ran out and there was a great explosion fit for the grandeur of Greater Britannia; nonetheless none of the gentlemen were able to witness the settling of this explosion, as by this point they were much too dead to be able to form an opinion about it at all."
 rebel_victoria.3.a: "What? The Black Hand has this capability?"
 rebel_victoria.3.b: "There is nothing we can do!"
 rebel_victoria.3.c: "The police! Notify the police!"
 rebel_victoria.4.t: "Detective Nerdface"
 rebel_victoria.4.d: "London's finest detective, Conan Nerdface, is now on the job."
 rebel_victoria.4.f: ""Pleased to meet you, lad. You're Ian, aren't you?"\n\n The second, younger man nodded nervously. "You're the famous detective Conan Nerdface!"\n\n "It's pronounced 'Dover', lad," the great detective said, twirling his magnifying glass about his fingers. "Now that the metropolitan police has assigned you under my supervision, it's about time we headed off." \n\n The detective grabbed his coat and deerstalker cap off his shelf, then led Ian outside, onto the filthy crowded streets of London, off to procure a clue..."
 rebel_victoria.4.a: "Buy a drink, and head off to the scene!"
 rebel_victoria.5.t: "An addict's revelations"
 rebel_victoria.5.d: "An Opium addict in a London Opium Den, the Blue Lotus, has given important clues as to the background of the Black Hand's bombing"
 rebel_victoria.5.f: "By all acounts Lester was a pathetic man. What had once been at least a somewhat handsome figure was now entirely ensared within the filthy red mattress next to the small vial of opium he so greedily indulged himself on nearly every ten seconds or so. Needless to say, Ian found this quite disturbing, but Conan was not fazed at all.\n\n"How can you stand this?" The former asked, to which Conan simply shrugged and attributed his tolerance to years of exposure to various environments bordering on inhospitable. Indeed, the area surrounding Lester was at least somewhat clean; the same could not be said for the rest of the room: dirtied cloths and god knows what else, uncleaned soot, and fluids Ian dared not identify. But Conan had set his priorities straight. He was doggedly interrogating the intoxicated, disheveled figure at his feet for any clues as to the whereabouts of the Black Hand.\n\n"I don't know anything about him! He didn't even come to my house last night!" the man suddenly shouted to them without any warning. He struggled to stand, yet only fell back down in his drugged stupor.\n\n Conan grimaced at the pathetic figure below him, then turned and flashed his most professional smile at the terrified serving girl. "Say, do you know where this lad lives?"\n\n"I'm not supposed to..." she muttered, blushing as Conan leaned closer.\n\n"Official business for Greater Britannia, Miss," he grinned at her, flashing his silver badge.\n\n"Oh, well," she muttered softly. Conan tilted his head invitingly, and she whispered an address into his ear. That was the end of their business in the Blue Lotus."
 rebel_victoria.5.a: "The plot thickens."

 north_american_path.1.d: "With nationalist sentiments rising across the country, the people of Britannian North America are at last seeking to claim what is rightfully theirs."
 north_american_path.1.f: "The North American state has long been silent. In the relative calm following the Conquests, a fragile stability has persisted between the four northern powers: the Iron Confederacy, the United States of America, and German North America. Despite troubles in Mexico recently, the north has been spared most of the turmoil that has increasingly appeared through the cracks of Britannia's dominance.\n\nBut this situation is not one that most are satisfied with. Britannian North America stands as by far the most powerful state out of the four, with the full backing of Greater Britannia's might, however long it may persist. Many now are questioning: if the nation truly has the power to dominate the continent, why should it not?\n\nAnd, some suggest, does it really need to place itself at the mercy of a falling power across the sea?"

The first time the United States enroached upon its homelands, the tribes banded together and centralized, yet even so they could not stave off the young empire.

Yet none expected them to have the audacity to strike at a German Crown colony.

There is almost no question as to how German North America will respond."
